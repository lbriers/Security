# HAL: ADC using HAL

This code example demonstrates the use of the [ADC HAL](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-hal-cat1/html/group__group__hal__adc.html) driver to perform voltage measurements. In this example, the ADC HAL driver is configured to sample input voltage periodically and display the sampled voltage on the UART. By default, the ADC is configured to use one channel in single-ended mode.

This example also demonstrates the multichannel configuration of the ADC HAL driver, which performs asynchronous reads from multiple channels. In this case, two channels are used. The first channel is configured in single-ended mode and the second channel is configured in differential mode.

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

   **Note:** By default, this application uses the single-channel configuration. In this configuration, one ADC channel is configured in single-ended mode and the channel input is configured to channel 0 input pin which is mentioned in **Table 1**. This application also supports multichannel configuration where two channels are configured; one channel is configured in single-ended mode with input from channel 0 input pin and the second channel is configured in differential mode with the two inputs Vplus and Vref mapped to channel 1 input pin and channel 1 voltage reference input pin respectively, pins are mentioned in **Table 1**. To use the multichannel configuration, by changing the `ADC_EXAMPLE_MODE` macro from `SINGLE_CHANNEL` to `MULTI_CHANNEL`.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Ensure that input voltage is provided at Channel 0 input pin which is mentioned in **Table 1** if a single channel configuration is chosen. Confirm that "HAL: ADC using HAL" and the input voltage are displayed on the UART terminal.

    **Figure 1. Terminal output with single-channel configuration**

    ![](images/single-channel-output.png)

5. If the multichannel configuration is chosen, ensure that the input voltages are provided at the Channel 0 input pin and Channel 1 input pin, pins are mentioned in **Table 1**. Provide a reference voltage at Channel 1 reference voltage input pin, which is mentioned in **Table 1**. Confirm that "PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: ADC using HAL"  and the input voltages from the two channels are displayed on the UART terminal.

    **Figure 2. Terminal output with multichannel configuration**

    ![](images/multichannel-output.png)

## Debugging


You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

<mark> Add the below Note for relevant CEs only, like PSoC 6 MCU based. Remove this note for others.

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

In this example, the ADC is configured with a 12-bit resolution; by default, one channel with a 0-VDDA range is configured using HAL. The input voltage is sampled every 200 ms by calling `cyhal_adc_read_uv`; the measured input voltage is displayed on the UART terminal.

This example also supports multichannel configuration. Multichannel configuration can be used by changing the `ADC_EXAMPLE_MODE` macro to `MULTI_CHANNEL`. The ADC is configured to use two channels; Channel 0 is configured in single-ended mode, while Channel 1 is configured in differential mode. The `cyhal_adc_read_async_uv` API function is used to read the results from the two channels asynchronously.

This code example uses a delay of 200 ms between reads for demonstration purposes to print the sampled results on the UART. To achieve sampling at higher rates, remove the delay and use the  `cyhal_adc_set_sample_rate` API function to configure the number of samples per second.

PSoC&trade; 6 HAL currently restricts the mapping of any GPIO pins as input to the ADC. Only pins that have a direct connection to the ADC can be used as inputs to the ADC. On all the supported boards, P10_x are the preferred GPIO pins as the input for the ADC because they directly connect to the ADC; therefore, Channel 0 input pin is used as the input for the first channel. Channel 1 input pin and Channel 1 voltage reference input pin are used for the second channel, pins are mentioned in **Table 1**.
